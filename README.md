# Customer Churn CSE204 Final Project

Readme last update: 18th May 2020

## Description

For this ML course final project, we tackle a binary classification problem of customer churn. Initially, the dataset used was the following from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn, where numerous projects have already obtained respectable scores. However, we later realised that richer data was available from IBM: https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113 which had more than double the number of features as the original dataset we worked with. The general structure of the project is quite classic:
- Preprocessing and cleaning of the data
- Some data analysis
- Applying algorithms
